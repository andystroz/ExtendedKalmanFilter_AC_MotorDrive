# Floating Point Extended Kalman Filter
This project demonstrates the use of a Floating Point Extended Kalman Filter for use in speed and position detection in AC motor drives as described in [1].

# Instructions
Clone project repository and run `test_kalman_floating.m`.
# Fixed point implementation
A fixed point implementation was tested in Matlab but did not successfully work. Extension of this project includes developing a fixed point implementation in C.
